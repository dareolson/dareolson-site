## Homepage Frog Animation

The frog is built from stacked 1920x1080 PNG layers inside a `#frog` container.
All artwork was drawn in Photoshop in black on transparent — `filter: invert(1)` in CSS
makes them render white on the dark site background.

`#frog` is scaled to 80% via `transform: scale(0.8)` — all coordinate math in frog.js
accounts for this FROG_SCALE factor.

**Layer stack (bottom to top):**
1. `body-static.png` — static, never changes
2. `layer-mouth` — swapped during eat animation (frames 1-4)
3. `layer-r-eyeball` / `layer-l-eyeball` — translated by JS to follow fly
4. `layer-r-eyelid` / `layer-l-eyelid` — swapped during blink animation
5. `#tongue-wrapper` div — rotated/scaled by JS; contains `layer-tongue` img (src swapped)

**Why the tongue is a wrapper div, not a direct img transform:**
Browsers reset `transformOrigin` when an `<img>` src changes. The wrapper div holds
the rotation and scaleX — the inner img only has its src swapped, so the pivot never drifts.

**Tongue pivot coords:** x:925, y:320 in the 1920x1080 canvas (`MOUTH_FRAC = {x:0.482, y:0.296}`)

## Frog Behaviors

| Behavior | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Eye tracking | mousemove (desktop) / fly wander position (mobile) | EYE_RANGE: 14px desktop, 7px mobile |
| Blink | Automatic — first blink at 1.5s, then random 2-6s intervals | Half → closed → half → open |
| Eat | Click empty space or text selection (desktop) / tap (mobile) | Tongue sequence: 2→3→2 |
| Fly wander | Mobile: always. Desktop: after eating until mouse moves | lerp toward random targets |
| Spawn new fly | After eating — enters from random screen edge | Desktop: lands at random spot, wanders autonomously |
| Nav eat | Clicking any nav link triggers eat first, then navigates | Uses `navigateWithFade()` |

## SEO and Discoverability

- Meta title, description, canonical URL on all pages
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- JSON-LD structured data (`Person` schema) on homepage
- `sitemap.xml` submitted to Google Search Console
- `llms.txt` at site root — plain-language context file for AI crawlers
- Google Search Console verified (HTML file method)
- Domain: `dareolson.com` is canonical; `www.dareolson.com` 301-redirects to it via GitHub Pages (fixed 2026-06-19 — canonical tags, og:url, og:image, and JSON-LD `url` previously pointed to `www`, contradicting the actual redirect direction)

## Session Log

### 2026-06-19 — GSC Audit + Canonical Mismatch Fix
- GSC: 1/12 indexed. Diagnosed `landing-page/` and `original-works/` as working redirect stubs (meta-refresh + canonical back to `/`), not abandoned pages — correct GitHub Pages workaround for lack of server-side 301s
- Found and fixed real bug: `index.html`, `pages/about.html`, `pages/contact.html`, `pages/work/index.html` all had canonical/og:url/og:image/JSON-LD pointing to `www.dareolson.com`, but the live server redirects `www` → bare domain. Fixed all to bare domain to match
- Submitted Request Indexing for `/pages/work/` via GSC URL Inspection — hit daily quota before doing `/pages/about.html` and `/pages/contact.html`
- TODO next session: request indexing for the remaining 2 real pages; ~6 unaccounted ghost URLs from a previous site version still showing in GSC (404 + crawled-not-indexed buckets) — not urgent, will decay naturally

## Analytics

GoatCounter — privacy-friendly, no cookies, no GDPR banner required.
Dashboard: https://dareolson.goatcounter.com
Installed on all 4 pages (homepage, work, about, contact).

---

## Page Transitions

`main.js` handles fade in/out between pages. Body starts at `opacity:0`.
On load, `.page-visible` class is added to fade in. On nav click, class is removed
to fade out before navigating. The frog's eat animation fires before navigation.

---

## Deployment Notes

- Push to `main` → GitHub Pages auto-deploys (usually 30–60 seconds)
- JS files use cache-busting query strings: `frog.js?v=65`
- Bump the `?v=` number whenever frog.js changes so browsers don't serve stale JS
- HTTPS enforced via GitHub Pages settings
